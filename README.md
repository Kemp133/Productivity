# Productivity

#### A productivity based application which runs in the command line to keep distractions to a minimum

## Who?

C'est moi, Johnathon

## What?

A productivity application which runs in the console. I procrastinate
incredibly easily so I'm hoping this application will help me get my s**t together

## Where?

Written by a Computer Scientist in England

## When?

Soon... hopefully

## Why?

As above, procrastination is a cruel mistress and I honestly have absolutely
no ability to avoid her charms. The amount I procrastinate is truly ungodly.
I'm hoping this application means I'm not distracted too much, as well as
having all the expandability I need to improve it in the future. I want to 
get to a point where I can have all the things I want to get done stored in
a local database, and then have a timetable produced which'll let me plan my
time better

## How?

With the power of code, mainly C# because I just did a Team Project for
Univeristy which involved making a game in Java which has honestly scarred me
for life with the language. Don't mention Java and JavaFX in the same sentence,
I'll either roll up into a ball in the corner and cry or get violent, and I don't
know which it'll be...
